        "Digital agencies and the future - Let's start with what a digital agency entails. Digital agencies are any company that delivers creative and technology based solutions to their clients. This can include anything from development and programming, design solutions, SEO and page rankings, and digital marketing + conversion increases. Each digital agency can handle a plethora of web services for clients in every industry. This allows companies to create an entire online presence without having to jump from company to company or freelancer to freelancer. It smooths out the complex process that awaits when building any sort of application on the web.",
      text2: " We created Site ppl to not only simplify and streamline the process for creators and firms, but also provide a fair price that suits each client. Part of the complexity that arises when building applications is pricing structures vary vastly from project to project. Many firms and creators are paying top notch pricing to firms not knowing what the service is costing on the other end. This is why our pricing structures are always transparent.  Whenever requested we can outline our process for choosing the procing structure for your project. We hope to increase revenue for our client over anything. We make money when your profit increases. Not only was Site ppl created to help bridge the problem in pricing, but also to work towards helping creators and firms stay updated in an ever-evolving digital world. Through research and case studies we have found many development and design firms give little to no attention to a client once the application is completed. This can be a major flaw for firms, especially when having to bring in others for updates and upkeep. Part of our job is to provide you with continued support, timely updates, continued growth, and upkeep at all times. Leaving development to a one off service can be a vital mistake in an exponentially growing digital world. We believe that the concept of digital agencies (or whatever you want to call our process), will be vital in the coming decades to online firms success, especially as complexity and abstraction grows. At Site ppl we believe in selfless innovation that elevates ppl past limits. Let us push the limits of the digital world for your firm.",
